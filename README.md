# Linear Regression

Here I implemented linear regression in the toolkit [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and train my model so as to predict Median House Value.

I used the [California Housing Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VUn2WKkKeRXwH02K9bqH98KjPxrUmgXh/view) subset to demonstrate my algorithms. 

During training I have been experimented with:

  1. Batch Gradient Descent
  2. Mini Batch Gradient Descent
  3. Stohastic Gradient Descent

***Note:*** My solution is implemented in Python and the report is well documented. For running the notebooks, I used the Google Colab with its GPU.
